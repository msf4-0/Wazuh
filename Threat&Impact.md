# Cyberattacks

**What is cyberattack?**

Cyberattacks are illegal attempts to steal, expose, change, disable, or destroy information via computer systems.

**Why does it happen?**

Criminally motivated attackers aim financial gain, data theft, or company interruption. Similarly, those who are personally motivated, like as unhappy present or former workers, will take money, data, or even an opportunity to disrupt a company's infrastructure.

**What is targeted?**

- Business Financial Information
- Client Information
- Email and Login Credentials
- Intellectual Properties (such as trade secrets or product designs)
- IT Infrastructure Access
- Sensitive Personal Information

## Types and Impact of Cyberattacks

### **Cross-site Scripting (XSS) Attacks**

To get a user's information, XSS attacks inject malicious code into a legitimate website or application script, frequently utilizing third-party online resources. JavaScript is widely used by attackers in XSS attacks.

#### **Impact of XSS**

XSS may create a wide range of issues for the end user, ranging from irritation to total account breach. The most serious XSS attacks include the disclosure of a user's session cookie, which allows an attacker to hijack the user's session and take over the account.

### **Denial-of-Service (DoS) / Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)**

DoS and DDoS attacks overwhelm a system's resources, prohibiting responses to service requests and reducing the system's ability to function. This attack is frequently used to build up another attack.

#### **Impact of DoS/DDoS**

The most visible and immediate result is that your website becomes overloaded and inaccessible. This indicates that any business you obtain through your website will be unavailable to you until the site is operational again. It also has an influence on your reputation as the owner of a website. Because of the enormous level of traffic, if your server hosts a service, it will also become unavailable.

A DDoS attack may make your site more vulnerable to hacking since all of your systems are focused on bringing the site back online, and security mechanisms may have been rendered unusable as a result of the attack. Once the DDoS attack has rendered your site unusable, hackers may find it easy to get access to your site through a back door.

### **Malware**

Malware is malicious software that may disable affected computers. Most malware versions destroy data by removing or erasing files required for the operating system to function.

#### **Impact of Malware**

- **Personal Information/ Identity Will be Retrieved and Spoofed:**
  
  Malicious software will access your system without your input, via emails or downloads, and attempt to acquire personal information. This is also known as identity theft. Malware runs in the background and captures every action you do. A malware, for example, records your browsing history, monitors the applications you use, and replicates personal information such as user IDs, passwords, bank account information, and so on. When malware obtains personal information, it gains control of your system's activities. It will send spam e-mails on someone's behalf in order to disrupt other linked devices in the company.

- **Access Sensitive Information:**
  
  Malware may quickly get access to critical company data by infiltrating a server system. It is one of the most serious consequences of malware for companies. It's also possible that malware causes hardware failure in some circumstances.

### **Phishing**

Phishing scams try to steal users' credentials or sensitive information such as credit card numbers. In this situation, scammers send users emails or text messages that appear to be from a credible source that contains fake URLs.

#### **Impact of Phishing**

A phishing attack is focused at password theft. When passwords are stolen, a cyber criminal has potentially gained access to a company's extremely private data. Once successfully hacked into an organization's network, thieves may install encryption ransomware, preventing access to systems and data until a ransom is paid. Expect significant business interruption as your IT staff work to detect the ransomware, engage with employees, upgrade security systems, negotiate with authorities, and restore the files.

### **Ransomware**

Ransomware is a complex malware that exploits system flaws and uses powerful encryption to encrypt data or system functions. Ransomware is used by cybercriminals to demand payment in return for freeing the system.

#### **Impact of Ransomware**

Ransomware has the ability to rapidly spread throughout an organization, impacting many devices and systems. Ransomware attacks may be disastrous for organizations, resulting in the loss of critical data and operational disruption. In several cases, organisations have had to pay enormous quantities of money to ransomware attackers, often in cryptocurrency so that it is difficult to identify who the organisation paid to.

### **SQL Injection**

SQL injection attacks inject malicious code in vulnerable applications, resulting in backend database query results and the execution of commands or similar actions that the user did not request.

#### **Impact of SQL Injection**

SQL injection can put the application at risk of breach, compromising data confidentiality and integrity as well as authentication and authorization parts of the application. An attacker can steal sensitive information such as user passwords, trade secrets, or transaction records from databases utilised by vulnerable systems or applications. SQL injection vulnerabilities should never be left unpatched; they must be addressed in all cases. If an application's authentication or authorisation components are compromised, an attacker may be able to login as any other user, such as an administrator, which escalates their privileges.

### **Zero-Day Exploit**

Zero-day exploit attacks make use of previously discovered hardware and software flaws. These problems might exist for days, months, or years before developers become aware of them.

#### **Impact of Zero-Day Exploit**

- **Data Theft:**
  
  A zero-day vulnerability may be used by attackers to steal important and sensitive data from your organization, staff, and clients. They may steal money, sell it to other criminals on the dark web, commit identity theft, or extort the victims using this info.

- **Account Takeover:**
  
  Attackers can use this flaw to gain unauthorised control and access to your network, website, server, application, or any other system. They may use phishing or malware to send harmful messages to your contact list.
