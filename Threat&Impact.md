# Cyberattacks

**What is cyberattack?**

Cyberattacks are illegal attempts to steal, expose, change, disable, or destroy information via computer systems.

**Why does it happen?**

Criminally motivated attackers aim financial gain, data theft, or company interruption. Similarly, those who are personally motivated, like as unhappy present or former workers, will take money, data, or even an opportunity to disrupt a company's infrastructure.

**What is targeted?**

- Business Financial Information
- Client Information
- Email and Login Credentials
- Intellectual Properties (such as trade secrets or product designs)
- IT Infrastructure Access
- Sensitive Personal Information

## Types and Impact of Cyberattacks

### **Cross-site Scripting (XSS) Attacks**

To get a user's information, XSS attacks inject malicious code into a legitimate website or application script, frequently utilizing third-party online resources. JavaScript is widely used by attackers in XSS attacks.

#### **Impact of XSS**

XSS may create a wide range of issues for the end user, ranging from irritation to total account breach. The most serious XSS attacks include the disclosure of a user's session cookie, which allows an attacker to hijack the user's session and take over the account.

### **Denial-of-Service (DoS) / Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)**

DoS and DDoS attacks overwhelm a system's resources, prohibiting responses to service requests and reducing the system's ability to function. This attack is frequently used to build up another attack.

#### **Impact of DoS/DDoS**

The most visible and immediate result is that your website becomes overloaded and inaccessible. This indicates that any business you obtain through your website will be unavailable to you until the site is operational again. It also has an influence on your reputation as the owner of a website. Because of the enormous level of traffic, if your server hosts a service, it will also become unavailable.

A DDoS attack may make your site more vulnerable to hacking since all of your systems are focused on bringing the site back online, and security mechanisms may have been rendered unusable as a result of the attack. Once the DDoS attack has rendered your site unusable, hackers may find it easy to get access to your site through a back door.

### **Malware**

Malware is malicious software that may disable affected computers. Most malware versions destroy data by removing or erasing files required for the operating system to function.

#### **Impact of Malware**

- **Personal Information/ Identity Will be Retrieved and Spoofed:**
  
  Malicious software will access your system without your input, via emails or downloads, and attempt to acquire personal information. This is also known as identity theft. Malware runs in the background and captures every action you do. A malware, for example, records your browsing history, monitors the applications you use, and replicates personal information such as user IDs, passwords, bank account information, and so on. When malware obtains personal information, it gains control of your system's activities. It will send spam e-mails on someone's behalf in order to disrupt other linked devices in the company.

- **Access Sensitive Information:**
  
  Malware may quickly get access to critical company data by infiltrating a server system. It is one of the most serious consequences of malware for companies. It's also possible that malware causes hardware failure in some circumstances.

### **Phishing**

Phishing scams try to steal users' credentials or sensitive information such as credit card numbers. In this situation, scammers send users emails or text messages that appear to be from a credible source that contains fake URLs.
